# Migration of legacy Jakarta EE application on JBoss EAP to modern Spring Boot application

Migrating a large legacy Jakarta EE application on JBoss EAP to a modern Java Spring application is a complex process that requires careful planning, risk mitigation, and step-by-step execution. The migration involves refactoring multiple layers of the application (UI, business logic, persistence, etc.), replacing Jakarta EE components (JSF, CDI, EJB, JPA, Bean Validation) with their Spring counterparts, and ensuring the application continues to function correctly during and after the migration.

Here is a structured, phased approach to this migration:

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Planning & Assessment
#### 1. **Codebase Analysis**
- **Understand the existing architecture**: Identify key modules and components—JSF for the UI layer, CDI for dependency injection, EJB for business logic, JPA for persistence, and Bean Validation for data integrity.
- **Assess dependencies**: List third-party libraries, Jakarta EE APIs in use, and proprietary JBoss-specific features (e.g., transaction management, security).
- **Identify database and external services**: Ensure you understand how the application interacts with the database, external services, or messaging systems.

#### 2. **High-Level Migration Strategy**
- **Migration approach**: Choose between **big-bang** migration (all at once) or **incremental migration** (iterative and parallel), where certain components of the application are migrated to Spring while others continue to run on Jakarta EE.
- **Infrastructure planning**: Ensure infrastructure compatibility (application servers, database, deployment pipelines). Spring Boot applications often require different configurations than JBoss.
- **Define KPIs**: Define what a successful migration looks like—performance, stability, maintainability, and scalability.

#### 3. **Setup a Parallel Development Environment**
- Build a sandbox or **parallel environment** for the new Spring app to avoid disruption of the production environment.
- **Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)** pipelines should be set up from the beginning to ensure constant testing and integration during migration.

### Phase 2: Migration of Core Application Components

#### 1. **UI Layer (JSF to Spring MVC or Thymeleaf)**
- **Replace JSF with Spring MVC or Thymeleaf**: Migrate the front-end views (e.g., `xhtml` in JSF) to Spring MVC (using `@Controller`) or to a templating engine like Thymeleaf.
- **Backwards compatibility strategy**: If the UI is large and complex, consider using a hybrid approach where the JSF pages remain but are gradually replaced by Thymeleaf or Spring MVC views.
- **Handle JSF-specific features**: JSF lifecycle, `@ManagedBeans`, and FacesContext can be replaced with Spring MVC request handling, `@Controller`, and `@RestController`.

**Task Breakdown**:
- Map JSF pages to equivalent Spring MVC controllers.
- Migrate `@ManagedBean` to `@Controller` or `@Service`.
- Replace JSF's tag libraries with Thymeleaf’s templates or Spring MVC’s JSP views.

#### 2. **CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) to Spring's DI**
- Replace CDI annotations like `@Inject`, `@Named`, `@RequestScoped`, etc., with Spring’s dependency injection (`@Autowired`, `@Component`, `@Scope`).
- Migrate `@SessionScoped`, `@RequestScoped` from CDI to Spring’s `@SessionScope` and `@RequestScope`.

**Task Breakdown**:
- Analyze beans managed by CDI and replace them with Spring-managed beans.
- Replace injection points with `@Autowired` and ensure the Spring context configuration is set up.

#### 3. **EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) to Spring Services**
- Replace stateless and stateful EJBs with Spring’s service layer (`@Service`, `@Transactional`).
- **EJB Transaction management**: EJBs have container-managed transactions. These can be handled in Spring using `@Transactional` with similar behavior.
- Replace any use of JNDI lookups with Spring's dependency injection.

**Task Breakdown**:
- Migrate `@Stateless` and `@Stateful` beans to Spring’s `@Service` or `@Component`.
- Use Spring’s declarative transaction management for `@Transactional`.

#### 4. **JPA (Java Persistence API) with Spring Data JPA**
- **Leverage Spring Data JPA**: Replace entity management (`EntityManager`) and DAOs with Spring Data JPA's repositories (`CrudRepository`, `JpaRepository`).
- Migrate persistence units defined in `persistence.xml` to Spring’s JPA configuration (e.g., `application.yml` or `application.properties`).
- Implement Spring's transaction management for database operations (via `@Transactional`).

**Task Breakdown**:
- Convert the persistence layer to use Spring Data JPA, updating `@Repository` and `@Entity` components.
- Migrate custom queries to Spring Data JPA methods or `@Query` annotations.

#### 5. **Bean Validation (Hibernate Validator)**
- Spring uses the same validation framework (Hibernate Validator). Migrate Jakarta EE’s `@Valid`, `@NotNull`, `@Size` annotations directly to Spring MVC or Spring services.
- Ensure proper integration of validation in form handling and REST APIs.

**Task Breakdown**:
- Verify that validation annotations are correctly handled in Spring’s controller and service layers.
- Use Spring’s `@Validated` for validating service-level methods.

### Phase 3: Incremental Testing & Validation

#### 1. **Establish a Comprehensive Test Suite**
- **Unit tests**: Use JUnit/Mockito for unit testing, ensuring that the new Spring components function as expected.
- **Integration tests**: Use Spring's `@SpringBootTest` for end-to-end integration testing.
- **UI Testing**: If the UI has migrated from JSF to Thymeleaf or Spring MVC, ensure UI functionality with Selenium or similar tools.
- **Database Testing**: Verify database queries using `@DataJpaTest` in Spring Boot.

#### 2. **Parallel Testing**
- In case of an incremental migration, ensure that the old JBoss EAP app and the new Spring Boot app can run in parallel, possibly sharing the same database.

---

### Phase 4: Gradual Rollout & Monitoring

#### 1. **Phased Rollout**
- If the application is large, consider a **modular migration** approach. Migrate individual modules (e.g., user management, reports) to Spring Boot, and integrate them back into the Jakarta EE app via APIs, until the whole system is on Spring.

#### 2. **Monitoring & Performance Testing**
- Continuously monitor the system to ensure that performance, scalability, and other non-functional requirements are met.
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Spring Boot’s Actuator for monitoring.

---

### Phase 5: Full Migration & Deployment

#### 1. **Final Cutover**
- Once all modules are migrated and thoroughly tested, finalize the migration by moving the whole application to Spring Boot.
- Ensure proper cloud deployment strategies or containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) are in place, if applicable.

#### 2. **Post-Migration Support**
- After migration, ensure post-migration support by closely monitoring production environments.
- Have a rollback plan and quick troubleshooting guides for issues.

### Key Software Engineering Principles to Follow

1. **Incremental Refactoring**: Break the migration down into manageable units and use incremental refactoring.
2. **Continuous Testing**: Integrate automated tests to validate each migration step.
3. **Modularization**: Treat each subsystem as a separate module that can be individually migrated and tested.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep presentation, business logic, and data access layers loosely coupled to simplify the migration.
5. **Document Everything**: Document the process and architecture decisions made during the migration to ensure knowledge transfer.

This structured approach reduces the risks associated with migrating a large legacy codebase, ensures smooth integration, and maintains quality during the process.
